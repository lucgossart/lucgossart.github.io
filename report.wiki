| Business value                                                   | Feared event | Impact | Gravity |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| Factory plans                                                    | 3., 7., 6.   | 6.     |         |

Focus on 2 or 3
Business value is the data, not integrity or confidentiality of it
Restrict perimeter to confidentiality
=== Supporting assets ===

1. IT service (7 computers, 2 laptops, wifi, ethernet, tablets, PAO
	 presentation tool)
2. USB keys where the files are stored
3. Paper documents
4. Expansive design software (ARC +, 	SIFRA, SPOT)
5. Website

== Feared events ==

1. k
2. 3. 
3. Spyware installed on computers (keep for threat scenario? 4th workshop)          IMPACT: Factory plans models and customers private data can be stolen GRAVITY: 3
4. Violation of integrity of calculations, generation of wrong plans   IMPACT: Buildings might collapse, some refactoring might be necessary, additional costs and delays GRAVITY: 4
5. Liability issues relative to the manipulation of private data of    IMPACT: Fine, lawsuits, negative impact on the brand    GRAVITY: 3
	 clients (be more specific)                                          
6. Robbery due to lack of control system (threat scenario?)            IMPACT: Loss of marketshares, fine (stealth of personal data of clients) GRAVITY: 3
7. Loss of marketshares due to spying and lack of confidentiality      IMPACT: Decline in revenue GRAVITY: 2


1. Leak of factory plan...
2. Continue with second business value
3. Only one feared event by BV
4. 
= Workshop 2: Risk sources =

1. Employee                      OBJECTIVE: Revenge, sell to the competitors MOTIVATION: +++ RESOURCES: ++ ACTIVITY: + PERTINENCE: Moderate
2. Competitors                   OBJECTIVE: Steal marketshares, acquire new technologies, improve their image MOTIVATION: +++ RESOURCES: +++ ACTIVITY: +++ PERTINENCE: High
3. Non related hackers           OBJECTIVE: Steal asset to sell (data, plans), train, add computers to a botnet MOTIVATION: ++ RESOURCES: ++/+++ ACTIVITY: ++ PERTINENCE: Moderate
4. State spies                   OBJECTIVE: Acquire new technologies, sabotage, gain information about military buildings MOTIVATION: + RESOURCES: +++ ACTIVITY: + PERTINENCE: Low
5. Ideological hacktivists       OBJECTIVE: Leak informations, stop production of military infrastructures MOTIVATION: + RESOURCES: ++ ACTIVITY: ++ PERTINENCE: Low
6. Service providers             OBJECTIVE: Sell data MOTIVATION: + RESOURCES: +++ ACTIVITY: + PERTINENCE: Low


Keep 1. and 2.

= Workshop 3: Strategic scenarios =

== Stakeholders ==

1. Clients                 DEPENDENCY: 4 PENETRATION: 2 CYBERMATURITY: 1 TRUST: 3 
2. Cleaning service        DEPENDENCY: 2 PENETRATION: 2 CYBERMATURITY: 1 TRUST: 2 
3. Service providers       DEPENDENCY: 3 PENETRATION: 3 CYBERMATURITY: 4 TRUST: 4 

== Threat scenarios ==

1. Spyware installed on computers (Competitors send malicious emails) GRAVITY: 3
2. Theft of computers/laptops (Competitor, unrelated robbers) GRAVITY: 3
3. Employee sells secret data about project GRAVITY: 2
4. Network access gained by competitors GRAVITY: 3

== Security measures == 

1. Encrypt data                                           RESIDUAL THREAT: 0,2
2. Restrict access privileges of employees                RESIDUAL THREAT: 0,8
3. Implement physical access regulation (alarms, etc.)    RESIDUAL THREAT: 0,5 
4. Authentication for network devices                     RESIDUAL THREAT: 0,5 

= Workshop 4: Operational scenarios =

1. Competitor bribes an eager employee and gets access to some confidential data       OVERALL LIKELIHOOD: 
2. The closet containing the USB drives gets forced open by the cleaning service, hired by the competitors, and the files are disclosed   OVERALL LIKELIHOOD:


= Workshop 5: =

Now evaluate in terms of motivations and resources
Be selective and keep short perimeter
Identify and evaluate stake holders and identify threat scenario
Focus today on one or two scenarios

= Questions for RÃ©mi =

1. How to evaluate residual threat?
2. Does it indicate a percentage of what is remaining?
3. What is expected about operational scenarios?
4. Should we put more operational scenarios in the final report?

5. What do they fear? Losing money, contracts (by access to data and technologies)
6. How specific do we need to be about the attacks etc.? As specific as possible (workshop 4)
7. What liability issues might the company have? Problems come from personal data, conversations
8. Keep integrity? No
9. Should we add something in the beginning about norms, GDPR...? no
