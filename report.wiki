Focus on 2 or 3
Business value is the data, not integrity or confidentiality of it
Restrict perimeter to confidentiality
=== Supporting assets ===

1. IT service (7 computers, 2 laptops, wifi, ethernet, tablets, PAO
	 presentation tool)
2. USB keys where the files are stored
3. Paper documents
4. Expansive design software (ARC +, 	SIFRA, SPOT)
5. Website

== Feared events ==

3. Spyware installed on computers (keep for threat scenario? 4th workshop)          IMPACT: Factory plans models and customers private data can be stolen SEVERITY: 3
4. Violation of integrity of calculations, generation of wrong plans   IMPACT: Buildings might collapse, some refactoring might be necessary, additional costs and delays SEVERITY: 4
5. Liability issues relative to the manipulation of private data of    IMPACT: Fine, lawsuits, negative impact on the brand    SEVERITY: 3
	 clients (be more specific)                                          
6. Robbery due to lack of control system (threat scenario?)            IMPACT: Loss of marketshares, fine (stealth of personal data of clients) SEVERITY: 3
7. Loss of marketshares due to spying and lack of confidentiality      IMPACT: Decline in revenue SEVERITY: 2


1. Leak of factory plan...
2. Continue with second business value
3. Only one feared event by BV
4. 
= Workshop 2: Risk sources =

1. Employee                      OBJECTIVE: Revenge, sell to the competitors MOTIVATION: +++ RESOURCES: ++ ACTIVITY: + PERTINENCE: Moderate
2. Competitors                   OBJECTIVE: Steal marketshares, acquire new technologies, improve their image MOTIVATION: +++ RESOURCES: +++ ACTIVITY: +++ PERTINENCE: High
3. Non related hackers           OBJECTIVE: Steal asset to sell (data, plans), train, add computers to a botnet MOTIVATION: ++ RESOURCES: ++/+++ ACTIVITY: ++ PERTINENCE: Moderate
4. State spies                   OBJECTIVE: Acquire new technologies, sabotage, gain information about military buildings MOTIVATION: + RESOURCES: +++ ACTIVITY: + PERTINENCE: Low
5. Ideological hacktivists       OBJECTIVE: Leak informations, stop production of military infrastructures MOTIVATION: + RESOURCES: ++ ACTIVITY: ++ PERTINENCE: Low
6. Service providers             OBJECTIVE: Sell data MOTIVATION: + RESOURCES: +++ ACTIVITY: + PERTINENCE: Low


Keep 1. and 2.

= Workshop 3: Strategic scenarios =

3. Service providers       DEPENDENCY: 3 PENETRATION: 3 CYBERMATURITY: 4 TRUST: 4 

== Threat scenarios ==

(Put in a table)

2. Spyware installed on computers (Competitors send malicious emails)
	 SEVERITY: 3 PROBABILITY: 2
3. Theft of computers/laptops (Competitor, unrelated robbers) SEVERITY:
	 3 PROBABILITY: 1

5. Network access gained by competitors SEVERITY: 3 PROBABILITY: 1 

== Security measures == 

1. Encrypt data                                           RESIDUAL THREAT: 0,2
2. Restrict access privileges of employees                RESIDUAL THREAT: 0,8
3. Implement physical access regulation (alarms, etc.)    RESIDUAL THREAT: 0,5 
4. Authentication for network devices                     RESIDUAL THREAT: 0,5 

= Workshop 4: Operational scenarios =

1. Competitor bribes an eager employee and gets access to some
	 confidential data       OVERALL LIKELIHOOD: 2 (SEVERITY: 3)
2. The closet containing the USB drives gets forced open by the
	 cleaning service, hired by the competitors, and the files are
	 disclosed   OVERALL LIKELIHOOD: 1 (SEVERITY: 4)
3. Some employee having access to confidential data opens a phishing
	 email sent by a hacker OVERALL LIKELIHOOD: 3 (SEVERITY: 3)


= Workshop 5: Risk treatment =

| Risk source         | Objectives                   | Severity | Mode of operation            | Likelihood |
| Employee/Competitor | Revenge (mettre deux lignes) | 3        | Use of credentials (bribing) | 2          |

 In this workshop we were able to identify some of the risks and threat
 scenarios that could happen to the company presented in the case study. In the
 table above we classified the previously discussed threat scenarios according
 to its gravity and likelihood, in order to better understand the overall risk
 of each of each scenario. We the presented scale we can conclude that the  R-
 is the worst threat and R- the least. In workshop 3 we discussed some measures
 that could help the company prevent such threats.
